database - mongodb

USER - id, username, password (hashed)
REFLECTION TEMPLATE - id, fileName (link to file name on server), lyricTemplate (array of object -- lyrics : duration (ms)), prompt (string), genre, mood, goal
    note : storing lyrics as array of lyrics w/ duration so frontend can take this and display lyrics for right amount of time
    note : when making templates, if one is modified, we make a new one entirely so new 
    other : store file names as array with last element being newest. That way, if the file name changes and we want to update a template, anything using the old name      
            will still be linked to the same template, reducing replication and keepying our templates synced

REFLECTION ANSWER -- answer (string, defaults to empty ), reflection template id, user id

LATER

put things in there and use defaults

when click, send answer and update reflection with response, store in global reflections answers store with user id to link

tools --> ffmpeg to encode then re-encode client side
