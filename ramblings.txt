database - mongodb

USER - id, username, password (hashed)
REFLECTION TEMPLATE - id, fileName (link to file name on server), lyricTemplate (array of object -- lyrics : duration (ms)), prompt (string), genre, mood, goal
    note : storing lyrics as array of lyrics w/ duration so frontend can take this and display lyrics for right amount of time
    note : when storing answers, use a seperate table where we duplicate the reflection template used. That way, if the original template changes, we still have the old 
            template that was used to reflect (data replication, but in this case division between tables is a featuer not a bug)
            ALSO so mutliple templates can reference the same mp3 if needed
REFLECTION ANSWER -- answer (string, defaults to empty ), fileName, lyricTemplate

LATER

put things in there and use defaults

when click, send answer and update reflection with response, store in global reflections answers store with user id to link

tools --> ffmpeg to encode then re-encode client side
