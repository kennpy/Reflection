Ideas

Embeded music videos paired with music and reflection templates
    - use royalty free music + background to start. Once concept is proven we can reach out to get legitemate pairs (music that is actually good)

let the music play out 

Frontend --> React so we can make a
 reflection component -- reflection box, audio file, prompt, submit button
 sidebard -- cache of past reflections

backend -- express.js , mongoose, passport (normal & google authentication)

database - mongodb

USER - id, username, password (hashed)
REFLECTION TEMPLATE - fileName (link to file name on server), lyricTemplate (array of object -- lyrics : duration (ms)),        
    note : storing lyrics as array of lyrics w/ duration so frontend can take this and display lyrics for right amount of time

ADD VIDEO --> MUSIC VIDEOS !!!
test and see if too messy --> if so tone it down and add more chill things

server -- aws ?? idk yet (figure this out later)
audio files - store somewhere else ? (not needed yet but maybe later -- "asset management software")

deployment -- idk ?? maybe goes with server

other tools - media.io (free vocal remover to generate background), soundful.com (ai music generator), pixbay.com (royalty free music downloader)

things to try -- next.js (server side rendering --> faster + cooler)
